Can we believe the majority of biological sciences research?
========================================================
- Yes?
- No?



Yes
========================================================

- Highly skilled researchers
- Peer review
- Robust scientific method


Yes but...
========================================================
incremental: true

- Highly skilled researchers
  + Who are self-taught
  + Who love to address new topics and use new techniques
  + Who are under huge pressure to publish, get grants, survive
- Peer review
  + Is full of bias against certain labs / techniques / new findings / old findings
  + Is slow
  + Publications can be corrected, but most are not (from my friend the meta-analyst)
  + Corrections are viewed very negatively, then forgotten
- Robust scientific method
  + ...
  

Do we spot our mistakes?
========================================================
incremental: true

Easily?

Not easily?
